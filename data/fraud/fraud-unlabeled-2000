He said it's also a good idea to request a new card even if the bank doesn't suggest a new card on the spot. After all, if someone has your card number, odds are good that more fraud charges, big or small, could continue.

But for reasons that the commission said it had not determined, complaints have spiked recently, leading to at least four enforcement actions.
The foundation of securities fraud class actions is a 1988 Supreme Court decision in the case Basic v. Levinson. It applied to fraud litigation a then-voguish economic theory, the efficient capital markets hypothesis, which posits that share prices reflect all publicly available information. The court said that when a broadly-traded corporation publicly misrepresents the truth, it perpetrates a "fraud on the market" - so individual shareholders need not show that they relied on corporate misstatements.

The signs of fraud, particularly mortgage fraud, were everywhere to be seen, yet he says the Department of Justice was notably cautious, a position articulated by Attorney General Eric Holder, who said prosecution could "have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy". All of this led to an emphasis on non-prosecution agreements where firms rather than individuals were fined.

Another driver causing the cost of fraud to rise to $308 (2014) from $279 (2013), a 10 percent increase, is retailers’ forays into the mobile channel, which is now a must-have tool to reach and engage customers. As the mobile channel grows, fraud is growing right along with it. This year’s study results indicate that mobile channel fraud costs merchants $334 for every $100 of fraud loss. Internet Retailer’s Mobile 500 states that sales through mobile commerce of the world’s top 500 retailers should reach $84 billion by the end of 2014. Many of the tools that are designed to stop fraud in the eCommerce channel aren’t always as effective in the mobile space.
Chargebacks can occur for several reasons, but a common reason is friendly fraud, or a consumer disputing a legitimate charge in order to defraud the merchant. Studies show that 23 percent of fraud losses reported by enterprise level e-commerce sites are proven instances of "friendly fraud" (1). As friendly fraud incidents have grown, so has merchants' necessity to dispute this unjust activity, which activity can result in fines, loss of revenue and increased processing costs. But while the right to dispute applies to every merchant, Eaton-Cardone says that credit card processors are taking that right away from merchants by refusing to allow them to dispute—a practice that is not only immoral, but also against Visa and MasterCard regulations, per Eaton-Cardone.

Eighty-five percent of cases termed "identity theft" involve the fraudulent use of an existing account, such as a credit card or bank account, according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. But consumer-protection laws and zero-liability policies limit the actual cost of that crime for most consumers to zero. A much smaller but more serious threat involves a thief assuming your identity and opening new accounts in your name.
In response to a Business Standard query, Adidas Group said: “At this stage, we want to reiterate Reebok India is a victim of the fraud described in the report.

Chip and PIN is Broken Vulnerabilities in the EMV Protocol EMV is the dominant protocol used for smart card payments worldwide, with over 730 million cards in circulation. Known to bank customers as "Chip and PIN", it is used in Europe; it is being introduced in Canada; and there is pressure from banks to introduce it in the USA too. EMV secures credit and debit card transactions by authenticating both the card and the customer presenting it through a combination of cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and the entry of a PIN. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a protocol flaw which allows criminals to use a genuine card to make a payment without knowing the card's PIN, and to remain undetected even when the merchant has an online connection to the banking network. The fraudster performs a man-in-the-middle attack to trick the terminal into believing the PIN verified correctly, while telling the issuing bank that no PIN was entered at all. The paper considers how the flaws arose, why they remained unknown despite EMV's wide deployment for the best part of a decade, and how they might be fixed. Because we have found and validated a practical attack against the core functionality of EMV, we conclude that the protocol is broken. This failure is significant in the field of protocol design, and also has important public policy implications, in light of growing reports of fraud on stolen EMV cards. Frequently, banks deny such fraud victims a refund, asserting that a card cannot be used without the correct PIN, and concluding that the customer must be grossly negligent or lying. Our attack can explain a number of these cases, and exposes the need for further research to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical security of bank payment systems. Smart cards have gradually replaced magnetic strip cards for point-of-sale and ATM transactions in many countries. The leading system, EMV (named after Europay, MasterCard, and Visa), has been deployed throughout most of Europe, and is currently being rolled out in Canada. As of early 2008, there were over 730 million EMV compliant smart cards in circulation worldwide. In EMV, customers authorize a credit or debit card transaction by inserting their card and entering a PIN into a point-of-sale terminal; the PIN is typically verified by the smart card chip, which is in turn authenticated to the terminal by a digital certificate. The transaction details are also authenticated by a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC), using a symmetric key shared between the payment card and the bank that issued the card to the customer (the issuer). EMV was heavily promoted under the "Chip and PIN" brand during its national rollout in the UK. The technology was advertised as a solution to increasing card fraud: a chip to prevent card counterfeiting, and a PIN to prevent abuse of stolen cards. Since its introduction in the UK the fraud landscape has changed significantly: lost and stolen card fraud is down, and counterfeit card fraud experienced a two year lull. But no type of fraud has been eliminated, and the overall fraud levels have actually risen (see Figure 1). The likely explanation for this is that EMV has simply moved fraud, not eliminated it. One goal of EMV was to externalise the costs of dispute from the issuing bank, in that if a disputed transaction has been authorised by a manuscript signature, it would be charged to the merchant, while if it had been authorised by a PIN then it would be charged to the customer. The net effect is that the banking industry, which was responsible for the design of the system, carries less liability for the fraud. The industry describes this as a 'liability shift'. In the past few years, the UK media have reported numerous cases where cardholders' complaints have been rejected by their bank and by government-approved mediators such as the Financial Ombudsman Service, using stock excuses such as 'Your card was CHIP read and a PIN was used so you must have been negligent.' Interestingly, an increasing number of complaints from believable witnesses indicate that their EMV cards were fraudulently used shortly after being stolen, despite there having been no possibility that the thief could have learned the PIN. In this paper, we describe a potential explanation. We have demonstrated how criminals can use stolen "Chip and PIN" (EMV) smart cards without knowing the PIN. Since "verified by PIN" -- the essence of the system -- does not work, we declare the Chip and PIN system to be broken. Speaker: Steven J.

In 2004, Congress passed legislation requiring immigrants to have work authorization in order to become entitled to Social Security benefits. Citizenship, however, is not a requirement to claim benefits. Despite tightening the law, Congress did not fix a loophole that allows immigrants who worked under false and invalid Social Security numbers to count earnings from those jobs toward entitlement to benefits. Once work authorization is received, and a claim for benefits is filed, the Social Security Administration uses all reported earnings from covered employment in the U.S. to determine benefits, even when the jobs were worked under fraudulent Social Security numbers.

Chip and PIN is Broken Vulnerabilities in the EMV Protocol EMV is the dominant protocol used for smart card payments worldwide, with over 730 million cards in circulation. Known to bank customers as "Chip and PIN", it is used in Europe; it is being introduced in Canada; and there is pressure from banks to introduce it in the USA too. EMV secures credit and debit card transactions by authenticating both the card and the customer presenting it through a combination of cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and the entry of a PIN. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a protocol flaw which allows criminals to use a genuine card to make a payment without knowing the card's PIN, and to remain undetected even when the merchant has an online connection to the banking network. The fraudster performs a man-in-the-middle attack to trick the terminal into believing the PIN verified correctly, while telling the issuing bank that no PIN was entered at all. The paper considers how the flaws arose, why they remained unknown despite EMV's wide deployment for the best part of a decade, and how they might be fixed. Because we have found and validated a practical attack against the core functionality of EMV, we conclude that the protocol is broken. This failure is significant in the field of protocol design, and also has important public policy implications, in light of growing reports of fraud on stolen EMV cards. Frequently, banks deny such fraud victims a refund, asserting that a card cannot be used without the correct PIN, and concluding that the customer must be grossly negligent or lying. Our attack can explain a number of these cases, and exposes the need for further research to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical security of bank payment systems. Smart cards have gradually replaced magnetic strip cards for point-of-sale and ATM transactions in many countries. The leading system, EMV (named after Europay, MasterCard, and Visa), has been deployed throughout most of Europe, and is currently being rolled out in Canada. As of early 2008, there were over 730 million EMV compliant smart cards in circulation worldwide. In EMV, customers authorize a credit or debit card transaction by inserting their card and entering a PIN into a point-of-sale terminal; the PIN is typically verified by the smart card chip, which is in turn authenticated to the terminal by a digital certificate. The transaction details are also authenticated by a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC), using a symmetric key shared between the payment card and the bank that issued the card to the customer (the issuer). EMV was heavily promoted under the "Chip and PIN" brand during its national rollout in the UK. The technology was advertised as a solution to increasing card fraud: a chip to prevent card counterfeiting, and a PIN to prevent abuse of stolen cards. Since its introduction in the UK the fraud landscape has changed significantly: lost and stolen card fraud is down, and counterfeit card fraud experienced a two year lull. But no type of fraud has been eliminated, and the overall fraud levels have actually risen (see Figure 1). The likely explanation for this is that EMV has simply moved fraud, not eliminated it. One goal of EMV was to externalise the costs of dispute from the issuing bank, in that if a disputed transaction has been authorised by a manuscript signature, it would be charged to the merchant, while if it had been authorised by a PIN then it would be charged to the customer. The net effect is that the banking industry, which was responsible for the design of the system, carries less liability for the fraud. The industry describes this as a 'liability shift'. In the past few years, the UK media have reported numerous cases where cardholders' complaints have been rejected by their bank and by government-approved mediators such as the Financial Ombudsman Service, using stock excuses such as 'Your card was CHIP read and a PIN was used so you must have been negligent.' Interestingly, an increasing number of complaints from believable witnesses indicate that their EMV cards were fraudulently used shortly after being stolen, despite there having been no possibility that the thief could have learned the PIN. In this paper, we describe a potential explanation. We have demonstrated how criminals can use stolen "Chip and PIN" (EMV) smart cards without knowing the PIN. Since "verified by PIN" -- the essence of the system -- does not work, we declare the Chip and PIN system to be broken. Speaker: Steven J.

SubscriberWise’s proposed ‘Child Master Index’ would alert creditors of a confirmed child social security number at the time of application origination. With an instant alert that the number matched is registered to a child, creditors would immediately stop the application process and require positive identification with government issued photo id. The process would protect the creditor from a potential fraudulent account. Most important, the technology would protect the child. The system would minimize synthetic identity thefts by reducing the frequency of child-based consumer credit reports. It’s reasonable to assume perpetrators would curb their attempt to defraud creditors and exploit children as awareness and education about a child-SSN index proliferated.

On August 12, 2013, a demand for arbitration styled Sandra G. Goebel vs. XTO Energy, Inc., Timberland Gathering & Processing Company, Inc. and Bank of America, N.A. was filed with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The claimant, Sandra Goebel, is a unitholder in the trust and alleged that XTO Energy breached the conveyances by misappropriating funds from the trust by failing to modify its existing sales contracts with its affiliate Timberland Gathering & Processing Company, Inc. ("Timberland"). Goebel alleged that these contracts did not currently reflect "market rate" terms, and that XTO had a duty to renegotiate the contracts to obtain more favorable terms. The claimant further alleged that Bank of America, N.A. (the previous trustee) breached its fiduciary duty by acquiescing to and facilitating XTO Energy's alleged self-dealing and concealing information from unitholders that would have revealed XTO Energy's breaches. The claim also alleged aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty by XTO Energy, and disgorgement and unjust enrichment by Timberland. The claimant sought from the respondents damages of an estimated $59.6 million for alleged royalty underpayments, exemplary damages, an accounting by XTO Energy, a declaration, costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. Goebel purported to sue on behalf of and for the benefit of the Hugoton Royalty Trust. Bank of America, N.A. filed a response to the arbitration demand denying any liability arising out of the claimant's allegations and objecting to the arbitrability of Goebel's claims against Bank of America, N.A. The arbitration panel ruled that Goebel's claims are not arbitrable and dismissed the claims in their entirety without prejudice. Goebel then refiled the matter as a lawsuit styled Sandra G. Goebel vs. XTO Energy, Inc., Timberland Gathering and Processing Company, Inc. and Bank of America, N.A. in Dallas County District Court. The allegations are the same as those contained in the previous arbitration demand. The Defendants filed a joint motion to stay the Goebel case in favor of the first filed Lamb case discussed below. The judge has conditionally stayed the case pending a ruling on Goebel's Motion to Intervene in the Lamb case. On September 5, 2014, however, Goebel withdrew her Motion to Intervene. That same day, Lamb filed a Motion to Voluntarily Dismiss his federal district court lawsuit. In that same Motion, Lamb stated that he intended to intervene and pursue his claims in the Goebel suit pending in state district court. Accordingly, if Lamb's suit is dismissed, it is possible that all claims regarding the conveyances and trust indenture will be litigated in state district court. XTO Energy has informed the trustee that it believes that XTO Energy has strong defenses to this lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend its position. Bank of America, N.A. has informed the trustee that it also believes it has strong defenses to the lawsuit and will vigorously defend its position. The terms of the trust indenture provide that Bank of America, N.A. and/or the trustee shall be indemnified by the trust and shall have no liability, other than for fraud, gross negligence or acts or omissions in bad faith as adjudicated by final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

"Time is money for advertisers," said WebSpectator CEO, Andre Parreira. "Advertisers go to great lengths to create content with the hope of resonating with their target consumers. That effort is irrelevant without a way to accurately gauge whether a consumer was actually exposed to it. The traditional digital advertising model assumes an ad served is an ad viewed, which is not always the case. Our work with a leading national online publisher has provided tangible proof that GTS is a necessity for the modern publisher. Using time as a metric is not only the best way to ensure ads are truly connecting with viewer eyes, but it is also free of all the fraud that has the digital advertising industry tied up in knots."

In the Apple case involving iTunes downloads, a 4-3 state Supreme Court majority opined that these privacy protections predated the advent of the internet and were therefore not applicable to online sales of downloadable products. The Court cited heightened risks for fraud in an online transaction, but it did not limit the ruling to permit information gathering for fraud prevention purposes. As a result, online merchants may require customers to provide all kinds of personally identifiable information, and they may use that information for marketing, building dossiers on consumers, or for sale to strangers.

The “fraud on the market” theory presumes that false statements by a company can improperly inflate the market price for its shares, so investors who buy stock at that price are overpaying and thus can later claim they were defrauded. According to this thinking, investors who claim they were defrauded do not have to show that they personally relied on the misstatements — or were even aware of them — in buying the stock.

Chip and PIN is Broken Vulnerabilities in the EMV Protocol EMV is the dominant protocol used for smart card payments worldwide, with over 730 million cards in circulation. Known to bank customers as "Chip and PIN", it is used in Europe; it is being introduced in Canada; and there is pressure from banks to introduce it in the USA too. EMV secures credit and debit card transactions by authenticating both the card and the customer presenting it through a combination of cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and the entry of a PIN. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a protocol flaw which allows criminals to use a genuine card to make a payment without knowing the card's PIN, and to remain undetected even when the merchant has an online connection to the banking network. The fraudster performs a man-in-the-middle attack to trick the terminal into believing the PIN verified correctly, while telling the issuing bank that no PIN was entered at all. The paper considers how the flaws arose, why they remained unknown despite EMV's wide deployment for the best part of a decade, and how they might be fixed. Because we have found and validated a practical attack against the core functionality of EMV, we conclude that the protocol is broken. This failure is significant in the field of protocol design, and also has important public policy implications, in light of growing reports of fraud on stolen EMV cards. Frequently, banks deny such fraud victims a refund, asserting that a card cannot be used without the correct PIN, and concluding that the customer must be grossly negligent or lying. Our attack can explain a number of these cases, and exposes the need for further research to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical security of bank payment systems. Smart cards have gradually replaced magnetic strip cards for point-of-sale and ATM transactions in many countries. The leading system, EMV (named after Europay, MasterCard, and Visa), has been deployed throughout most of Europe, and is currently being rolled out in Canada. As of early 2008, there were over 730 million EMV compliant smart cards in circulation worldwide. In EMV, customers authorize a credit or debit card transaction by inserting their card and entering a PIN into a point-of-sale terminal; the PIN is typically verified by the smart card chip, which is in turn authenticated to the terminal by a digital certificate. The transaction details are also authenticated by a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC), using a symmetric key shared between the payment card and the bank that issued the card to the customer (the issuer). EMV was heavily promoted under the "Chip and PIN" brand during its national rollout in the UK. The technology was advertised as a solution to increasing card fraud: a chip to prevent card counterfeiting, and a PIN to prevent abuse of stolen cards. Since its introduction in the UK the fraud landscape has changed significantly: lost and stolen card fraud is down, and counterfeit card fraud experienced a two year lull. But no type of fraud has been eliminated, and the overall fraud levels have actually risen (see Figure 1). The likely explanation for this is that EMV has simply moved fraud, not eliminated it. One goal of EMV was to externalise the costs of dispute from the issuing bank, in that if a disputed transaction has been authorised by a manuscript signature, it would be charged to the merchant, while if it had been authorised by a PIN then it would be charged to the customer. The net effect is that the banking industry, which was responsible for the design of the system, carries less liability for the fraud. The industry describes this as a 'liability shift'. In the past few years, the UK media have reported numerous cases where cardholders' complaints have been rejected by their bank and by government-approved mediators such as the Financial Ombudsman Service, using stock excuses such as 'Your card was CHIP read and a PIN was used so you must have been negligent.' Interestingly, an increasing number of complaints from believable witnesses indicate that their EMV cards were fraudulently used shortly after being stolen, despite there having been no possibility that the thief could have learned the PIN. In this paper, we describe a potential explanation. We have demonstrated how criminals can use stolen "Chip and PIN" (EMV) smart cards without knowing the PIN. Since "verified by PIN" -- the essence of the system -- does not work, we declare the Chip and PIN system to be broken. Speaker: Steven J.

They waste taxpayer money going after the Gary and Clif's of the world in what appears to be nothing more than a full employment act for current, future and former SEC attorneys. They should be concerned with the issues that truly impact investor confidence. The things that matter. Finding Ponzi schemes, penny stock frauds, market structure issues like high-frequency trading. If it adds risk and costs to the entire market, deal with it. Investors are concerned with actions, transactions and risks that can cause them to lose all of their money. Non Criminal Insider Trading is not one of those things. Right now its just a waste of taxpayer money. Money that the SEC says it doesn't have enough of.

To backers of Bitcoin, the Citigroup revelation was a convenient rhetorical weapon: Look, the digital currency’s boosters say, if one of the world’s largest and most tightly regulated financial institutions can also lose a boatload of money, why is everyone getting so bent out of shape about the $470 million collapse of Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange? In the last few years the conventional financial system has lurched from one new fraud to another — from Bernie Madoff to MF Global to the hacking at Target — and yet nobody suggests abandoning dollars as a means of trade. Why aren’t we just as forgiving in our approach to Bitcoin?

The law firm’s involvement quickly became problematic. Chevron went after Donziger, alleging the verdict was the result of improper evidence, including a key expert report. In March this year, a federal judge in New York sided with Chevron, ruling that the verdict in Ecuador was the product of fraud and racketeering, and that the judgment should not be enforced – but did not rule on whether Patton Boggs had also engaged in wrongdoing. Shortly afterward, however, the judge allowed Chevron to pursue claims against Patton Boggs for allegedly committing fraud while trying to enforce the judgment. The matter was finally settled earlier this month, when Patton Boggs agreed to pay Chevron $15 million in exchange for Chevron agreeing to release all claims against the law firm and its partners.

Off-label marketing fraud cases have involved systematic manipulation of the regulatory scheme governing pharma products and treatment of patients by doctors to maximize profits for the drugmakers. On the one hand, the Food and Drug Administration approves drugs, biologics and medical devices as safe and effective for specified uses. Once the product has been 'approved' for that use, the manufacturer may market that product for the approved use. According to the FDA, if a company markets for a different use and engages in interstate commerce for that unapproved use, the drug is "misbranded." In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (which oversees which products are paid for by government healthcare programs) require that drug advertising "must be truthful, not misleading, and limited to approved uses." A company may not sell a misbranded product and Medicare and Medicaid will not buy misbranded products. On the other hand, nothing prohibits a doctor from prescribing an approved product for an un-approved use if the doctor determines it is beneficial in the treatment of the patient. Between these two poles lies an ocean of potential revenue.

However, most spam emails (especially malicious ones with a trojan/virus payload, or those advertising a web site) forge this address too, and replying to it will annoy an innocent third party.

In some cases, we also resort to physical verification that includes clicking of photos and scanning of documents. We want the right kind of business to come in through our channel partners," Stanley said.

OK, you can't use cash online. But please, use a credit card, not a debit card. The fraud protections are better, and a hacker can't overdraft your bank account with a credit card. You don't need to be fighting overdraft fees on top of everything else.

We ought to know, for instance, how and when these names got on the payroll and for how long they have been there. The security agencies should tell Nigerians into what accounts the monies so fraudulently drawn have been paid over the years; and the total sum the nation has lost so far. Beyond this, there is the matter of the criminal collusion of principal officers of state who carry out their policing and monitoring roles in the breach. It is unacceptable that Nigerians should be periodically regaled with tales of discovery of ghost workers, while no visible attempts are made to get to the bottom of such fraud and bring the wrath of the law to bear on its perpetrators. The Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, (IPPIS) launched by the Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, uncovered most of the fraud through the use of biometric data capture machine. Because ghosts have no finger prints, the bubble burst for those behind the inflated staff figures. Forthwith, the fake workers who have regularly survived the "pay at sight" charade of the ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) stood out like sour thumbs. The level of collusion here is really the issue and queries should be raised about auditing irregularities.

Think detectives and the first impression is that of gumshoes operating out of holes in the wall and thriving on bread and butter assignments like infidelity checks and spying on spouses. Today, however, the branch of business investigation has evolved and is a far more intense and professional one. With the entry of the Big Four audit and accounting firms and foreign investigation firms, the services on offer have a huge range and depth. These investigators rely a lot on human intelligence, marketing intelligence gathering, tapping of anonymous sources on top of public document searches and analytics. The assignments they pick up range from investigating fraud and espionage from within (by employees) and without (by suppliers, competitors and others).

President Goodluck Jonathan sent the Pension Reform Bill to the National Assembly as his administration's response to the numerous challenges facing Nigeria's pension system. Mr. President's action has no doubt cleared any question about his government's commitment to pension reform and fighting corruption in the sector. It was against this backdrop that pension stakeholders led by NLC resolved that they were going to support political parties based on their pension policies and also vote candidates for election based on their commitment to pension reform. I praise the efforts of the National Assembly and pension stakeholders for jointly and overwhelmingly condemning the fraud that characterised pension administration in the country and resolving to tackle the menace. In the wake of the mindboggling pension funds looting saga, our federal legislators had taken the bull by the horns to sanitise our pension system. Even though the National Assembly does not administer pension, it offers intervention where necessary through laws that set standards and encourage best practices that take care of pension problems and curb corruption. The National Assembly insisted it must not be business as usual and made pension reform a national priority.

During the seven-week RICO and fraud trial, Chevron presented unrebutted evidence detailing the extent of the fraudulent acts undertaken and directed by Donziger, his Ecuadorian legal team and other associates, including fabricating environmental evidence, pressuring scientific experts to falsify reports, plotting to intimidate judges into handing down favorable rulings, bribing court-appointed experts, ghostwriting court reports and even drafting the final judgment. Today’s judgment made clear that Donziger and his associates resorted to fraud due to the lack of evidence to support their claims against Chevron.

On March 4, 2014, Judge Lewis Kaplan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in Ecuador was the product of fraud and racketeering activity, finding it unenforceable in the United States and holding Donziger liable for RICO violations. Patton Boggs began working with Donziger and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in early 2010 in exchange for a stake in the Ecuadorian judgment. Patton Boggs also filed a series of three separate lawsuits on its own behalf in the United States against Chevron. All of that firm’s claims against Chevron were rejected by U.S. federal courts. On March 31, 2014, Judge Kaplan granted Chevron’s application to pursue counterclaims against Patton Boggs relating to that firm’s role in connection with the Ecuadorian action and related litigations against the company. Today’s settlement resolves those counterclaims.
My husband's uncle immediately alerted his credit card issuer about the $11.18 charge and he was told not to pay it. But a new card wasn't issued right then. Maybe one should have been to prevent the later fraud charges. Sometimes the fraudsters start out with small charges to check if a number is "live" and can be used to make bigger purchases. Or the con artists keep making more fake small charges just to keep the scam going.

Target isn’t doing much to help correct this misconception with its offer of free credit monitoring for affected customers. “The reason Target is offering ID theft protection as a result of this breach is that this step has become part of the playbook for companies that suffer a data breach,” Krebs says. “Since most consumers conflate credit card fraud with ID theft, many will interpret that to mean that the breached entity is somehow addressing the problem.” In other words, it’s a feel-good marketing move that doesn’t really help the situation.

During his tenure, Mr. Bocian oversaw investigations and prosecutions pertaining to government corruption and federal program fraud, federal contractor fraud, commercial and public sector kickbacks, tax fraud, and other white collar and financial crimes, and tried numerous cases in federal court.
Fraud allegations were likely from both campaign teams after the run-off vote, and a close count could lead to a contested result as the country undergoes its first democratic transfer of power.
Martoma’s prosecution is part of a multi-year federal investigation into SAC Capital. Last year, SAC was charged with securities and wire fraud for a decade-long scheme in which the fund engaged in a pattern of “systematic insider trading” that allowed it to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal profits. Last November, SAC agreed to settle the case by paying $1.8 billion and pleading guilty to fraud charges. Cohen has not been charged criminally, but faces civil charges for failing to supervise Martoma and another former SAC trader, Michael Steinberg, who last month was convicted of insider trading charges.
Bank of America also enrolled consumers in identity protection credit card add-on products, known as “Privacy Guard,” “Privacy Source,” and “Privacy Assist,” that promised to monitor customer credit and alert consumers to potentially fraudulent activity. Under federal law, in order for Bank of America or its vendors to obtain consumers’ credit information, the consumers generally must authorize access to credit information. Bank of America, however, billed consumers for these products without or before having the authorization necessary to perform the credit monitoring and credit report retrieval services. As a result, the company:
More recently, the agency began using software that scans the financial statements companies file, assesses risk factors and generates a score that identifies outliers within a peer group. The SEC also wants to enhance a system that flags potential insider trading by identifying individuals who trade in unison around certain market events, and another that aims to combat hedge fund fraud by sniffing out unusual fund performance.
The investors suing Halliburton argue that the fraud-on-the-market principle remains sound and that the class-action cases help deter fraud.

The sheep are jumping up and down with joy that Congress reached a debt limit deal. This is actually a move by the elites to ensure the inevitable collapse will be even worse. More here: http://billhweld.blogspot.com Congress and Obama essentially committed treason today, and have done so every time they raise the debt limit. There is a reason for this, as my source explains. "Billionaires Dumping Stocks, Economist Knows Why" http://www.moneynews.com/MKTNews/billionaires-dump-economist-stock/2012/08/29/id/450265?PROMO_CODE=110D8-1&utm_source=taboola A RECAP ON WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO: Classified docs on "Nano Domestic Quell" DoD kill-switch program released by Dr. Bill H. Weld The program is called "Nano Domestic Quell". This is how the military will be respond to the economic collapse, and how they will put down armed uprisings, riots and domestic revolts. As promised, these are some of the classified documents given to me by my good friend in the Department of Defense, a very highly ranked official I have known for many years. As the documents clearly demonstrate, the U.S. government has embarked on a program to implement a secret "Armageddon nano device" that mimics a flu virus, to be activated on the public in the instance of domestic uprisings, riots and armed resistances. The nano devices are in, or "carried" by, an estimated 87% of the population at this point, with a projected 98% inflected by 2014. Chances are, you already have this nano device inside of your body as you read this. Please understand: these nano devices are inert until activated by a radio signal or transmission. You are safe until a cell tower, drone or other method of transmission activates the device. (I do not personally know how this transmission works. The documents I've received do not go into any detail on that specifically. I do know drones and cell towers will be used, however.) Once activated, the device will mimic the flu virus. You will be dead within 10 to 12 days. There is no known cure or way to prevent this. (I go into more detail on this in some of my videos, of which I recommend viewing all of them to fully understand and appreciate what is going on.) Please bear in mind that there is an active campaign underway to discredit me, attack me and bring me down. Please understand my children are sick and I believe their sickness -- a bizarre skin condition that is worsening for both of them -- is a result of my blowing the whistle. I believe they have been harmed intentionally. I believe they are trying to send me a message by messing with my children. I need your help. I need your trust. I need you to help this spread. If it doesn't spread or go viral in some manner, we are finished, because they will continue to destroy me, remove any trace of me from the internet (records from my some of my previous employers are already missing, among other things), they will destroy me and the public will never find out about this. Please pray for us, pray for my wife, Helena, my son, Bill Jr., my daughters, Katherine and Grace. We need your help more than ever. If you need to contact me, please feel free to email me personally: billhweld@yahoo.com In Christ, Dr. Bill H. Weld P.S.

And the credit card industry flourished.

"But given community detention she says that will need to take time to build up her reputation again and clientele. She has lost a lot of her contracts." Keung said the fraud was not deliberate as she had been contacted by her overseas supplier that they were sending the iPhones.

In its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, KVH reported a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting arising from a fraudulent scheme by the most senior member of its accounting staff at its Danish subsidiary to misappropriate assets from KVH over a period of at least three years. The scheme included fraudulent wire transfers to a personal bank account, fraudulent documentation, forged signatures and use of a corporate credit card for personal expenses. For the three years ended December 31, 2013, the aggregate amount of misappropriated funds in any year ranged from approximately $118,000 to $250,000. KVH recovered these losses in 2013 through its insurance policies. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of KVH's internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2012 identified the following control deficiencies at its Danish subsidiary as a material weakness: (i) override of access controls over banking security devices and personal identification numbers enabling the unauthorized execution of wire transfers, (ii) ineffective review controls over the supporting documentation by the subsidiary country general manager over expenditures and expenses, and (iii) override of review controls designed to address the accuracy and approval of manual journal entries at the Danish subsidiary.

Chip and PIN is Broken Vulnerabilities in the EMV Protocol EMV is the dominant protocol used for smart card payments worldwide, with over 730 million cards in circulation. Known to bank customers as "Chip and PIN", it is used in Europe; it is being introduced in Canada; and there is pressure from banks to introduce it in the USA too. EMV secures credit and debit card transactions by authenticating both the card and the customer presenting it through a combination of cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and the entry of a PIN. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a protocol flaw which allows criminals to use a genuine card to make a payment without knowing the card's PIN, and to remain undetected even when the merchant has an online connection to the banking network. The fraudster performs a man-in-the-middle attack to trick the terminal into believing the PIN verified correctly, while telling the issuing bank that no PIN was entered at all. The paper considers how the flaws arose, why they remained unknown despite EMV's wide deployment for the best part of a decade, and how they might be fixed. Because we have found and validated a practical attack against the core functionality of EMV, we conclude that the protocol is broken. This failure is significant in the field of protocol design, and also has important public policy implications, in light of growing reports of fraud on stolen EMV cards. Frequently, banks deny such fraud victims a refund, asserting that a card cannot be used without the correct PIN, and concluding that the customer must be grossly negligent or lying. Our attack can explain a number of these cases, and exposes the need for further research to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical security of bank payment systems. Smart cards have gradually replaced magnetic strip cards for point-of-sale and ATM transactions in many countries. The leading system, EMV (named after Europay, MasterCard, and Visa), has been deployed throughout most of Europe, and is currently being rolled out in Canada. As of early 2008, there were over 730 million EMV compliant smart cards in circulation worldwide. In EMV, customers authorize a credit or debit card transaction by inserting their card and entering a PIN into a point-of-sale terminal; the PIN is typically verified by the smart card chip, which is in turn authenticated to the terminal by a digital certificate. The transaction details are also authenticated by a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC), using a symmetric key shared between the payment card and the bank that issued the card to the customer (the issuer). EMV was heavily promoted under the "Chip and PIN" brand during its national rollout in the UK. The technology was advertised as a solution to increasing card fraud: a chip to prevent card counterfeiting, and a PIN to prevent abuse of stolen cards. Since its introduction in the UK the fraud landscape has changed significantly: lost and stolen card fraud is down, and counterfeit card fraud experienced a two year lull. But no type of fraud has been eliminated, and the overall fraud levels have actually risen (see Figure 1). The likely explanation for this is that EMV has simply moved fraud, not eliminated it. One goal of EMV was to externalise the costs of dispute from the issuing bank, in that if a disputed transaction has been authorised by a manuscript signature, it would be charged to the merchant, while if it had been authorised by a PIN then it would be charged to the customer. The net effect is that the banking industry, which was responsible for the design of the system, carries less liability for the fraud. The industry describes this as a 'liability shift'. In the past few years, the UK media have reported numerous cases where cardholders' complaints have been rejected by their bank and by government-approved mediators such as the Financial Ombudsman Service, using stock excuses such as 'Your card was CHIP read and a PIN was used so you must have been negligent.' Interestingly, an increasing number of complaints from believable witnesses indicate that their EMV cards were fraudulently used shortly after being stolen, despite there having been no possibility that the thief could have learned the PIN. In this paper, we describe a potential explanation. We have demonstrated how criminals can use stolen "Chip and PIN" (EMV) smart cards without knowing the PIN. Since "verified by PIN" -- the essence of the system -- does not work, we declare the Chip and PIN system to be broken. Speaker: Steven J.

Follow us on TWITTER: http://twitter.com/cnforbiddennews Like us on FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/chinaforbiddennews It is reported that on suspicion of fraudulent accounting practices of nine U.S.-listed Chinese companies, the powerful Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) demanded that the Big Four release the audit information of their clients. However, the Big Four refused to present the data about companies based in China and listed in the U.S., saying they endeavored to comply with Chinese secrecy laws. A U.S. SEC judge has decided that the Chinese units of the Big Four accountants should be suspended from auditing. The Big Four are Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC, the four largest professional accounting firms in the world On January 23, the U.S. SEC decided to suspend the Chinese branches of the Big Four for six months. The reason is that the Big Four refused to provide work papers of the audits to the SEC for conducting investigations of suspected financial fraud of US-listed Chinese companies. Beijing CPA, Du Yanlin, once an audit manager of overseas-listed Sinopec, suspects the problem lies in the audit papers. Du Yanlin, Beijing CPA: "Take Sinopec for example. If Sinopec is suspected of fraud, it is questionable if any fraud would show in the audit. It is very hard to trace it because they might manipulate the data through other ways There also might be some clues in paperwork. The Big Four could have deleted the clues during the audit as long as it does not violate the principles. However, the SEC does not believe so." The Big Four handle the vast majority of audits for large international companies in their Chinese subsidiaries. The vast majority of US-listed Chinese companies also choose the Big Four as their auditing agencies in order to gain the trust of the SEC. Shanghai Securities News speculate that the six month suspension will result in a change of audit services of international Chinese companies. More than 200 US-listed Chinese companies will also make the switch. This is evidently causing tremendous losses to those Chinese companies in the process of being listed in the US. Lee Li, Former PwC CPA: "The financial statements of listed companies are open to the public. It helps investors and creditors to assess the business. In general, audited financial statements are relatively credible. Fraudulent financial statements often mislead investors." Arthur Andersen was once the world's largest accounting firm. Its fraudulent practices and obstruction of justice finally discredited the company and turned the Big Five into the Big Four. The BBC Chinese report pointed out the skepticism of the data the Chinese companies have presented. To cut taxes or receive tax credits, false sales and profits are generally reported. The official data may also be altered for political purposes. WSJ reported that at least 130 such companies encountered questions about their accounting or disclosures, starting around 2010. Many of the companies had gained access to U.S. markets through "reverse mergers." The long arm of the SEC has filed about 20 lawsuits and administrative proceedings against various Chinese companies and their executives over the past two years, alleging a variety of fraudulent practices. That wave of alleged problems caused the companies' stocks to plunge, costing U.S. investors billions of dollars on paper. Since 2011, the SEC have since clamped down on the use of reverse mergers to get onto U.S. exchanges. The Big Four's refusal to cooperate with the request to share papers for relevant investigation has resulted in the SEC's administrative proceeding against them, reported the WSJ. The Big Four argue that they tried to comply with Chinese secrecy laws. Du Yanlin: "The Big Four could have resisted the SEC with the official support of the communist regime, and considerations for the aspect of business in China. The communist regime is a complex Government, with too many secrets, not necessarily trade secretes , but many more besides." The Big Four are preparing to appeal. Du Yanlin indicates that if it were in China, any audit firm, including the Big Four, would have to comply and cooperate unconditionally. 《神韵》2014世界巡演新亮点 http://www.ShenYunPerformingArts.org/

As a result, legislation is in the works which would mandate timely reporting of security breaches which can help consumers once their information has been compromised. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy earlier this month introduced a new version of a 2005 bill that would set criminal penalties for intentional or willful concealing of a personal data breach that causes economic damage to consumers. It also ensures that conspiring or attempting to commit computer fraud would face the same penalties as completed offenses. Sen. Tom Carper (D.-Del.) has also discussed reintroducing a bill that creates a reporting standard for breaches. Accurate and timely reporting of breaches in compliance with this proposed legislation is facilitated by continuous monitoring of core network systems and activity.

He's put his political ambitions first and turned his back on the constitutional right of Wisconsinites to vote. He is aiding and abetting the fraudulent manipulation of the rules on voting being perpetrated by the Republican controlled legislature." Early voting has become an increasingly popular way for Wisconsinites to do their civic duty and have a say in the direction of their communities. In fact, 58 Republican legislators who have supported restrictions on early voting have themselves voted early. The impacts of the law will be felt heavily in urban areas where long lines are a serious issue at the polls and creates significant new challenges for minorities, seniors, working families and persons with disabilities in accessing the franchise. Walker signed the legislation despite a mere 12% of respondents in a recent statewide poll endorsing the new restrictions on early voting proposed in the bill presented to Walker for his signature. "This fight is far from over. It may be Governor Walker's signature on the bill today, but this fight will end when a judge signs an order declaring this latest Republican attack on voting unconstitutional," concluded Ross. ### RELEASE FROM UNITED WISCONSIN: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 3/27/14 CONTACT Lisa Subeck, United Wisconsin Lisa@unitedwisconsin.com cell: 608.358.7090 Erik Kirkstein, United Wisconsin Erik@unitedwisconsin.com cell: 414.520.1377 Gov. Walker Signs Bill Restricting Access to In-Person Absentee Voting SB 324 puts politics ahead of people, aimed at suppressing the vote of seniors, minorities, and working families ahead of November election MADISON -- Today, Governor Scott Walker signed into law Senate Bill 324, which places new limits on in-person absentee voting, including a complete ban on early voting during evenings and weekends. "Senate Bill 324 is one of many attempts by Republicans over the last 3 years to suppress the votes of those they see as unfavorable to their own candidates and their own political futures," said United Wisconsin Executive Director Lisa Subeck. "Governor Walker had the opportunity to put people ahead of politics by standing up for voting rights and vetoing SB 324." In-person absentee voting has provided municipalities with the tools they need to ensure every eligible voter has access to the ballot. Municipal Clerks currently have the ability to respond to the unique needs of their own communities and prevent long lines at the polls on Election Day. SB 324 takes vital tools away from our local clerks. Governor Walker did remove a provision of the bill that limits total hours for in-person absentee voting to 45 hours but maintained the bill's prohibitions against evening and weekend voting. "While Walker opted to remove the part of this broken law that limits total in-person absentee hours to 45 per week, that is little consolation to those Wisconsin citizens who cannot take time off work or who lose pay for time taken off during the traditional work week," said Subeck. Public outcry against SB 324 has increased in the week since the Republican dominated State Assembly passed the bill last week, including opposition from the editorial boards of major newspapers across the state. A recent poll conducted by Marquette Law School found that 66% of Wisconsinites prefer expanding or maintaining current early voting hours, while only 17% favored a reduction. "Today, Governor Walker put politics ahead of people by signing SB 324," Subeck said. "His actions amount to betrayal of trust of the hundreds of thousands of Wisconsin seniors, veterans, students, and working people who regularly exercise their right to vote via early absentee ballot." # # # United Wisconsin is an independent, grassroots organization of citizens restoring the Wisconsin tradition of democracy in action.

“Keep in mind, these were completely separate businesses,” Andrew Madoff told Safer, referring to the division between the real and fraudulent operations at the investment firm. “We were executing hundreds of thousands of transactions a day. And that kept all of us incredibly busy. And it just didn’t occur to me that he could be involved in any kind of criminal activity.”

Other companies, including hotel management company White Lodging Services and the arts and crafts store chain Michaels, are investigating possible breaches after fraud was detected on payment cards used by their customers.
Chip and PIN is Broken Vulnerabilities in the EMV Protocol EMV is the dominant protocol used for smart card payments worldwide, with over 730 million cards in circulation. Known to bank customers as "Chip and PIN", it is used in Europe; it is being introduced in Canada; and there is pressure from banks to introduce it in the USA too. EMV secures credit and debit card transactions by authenticating both the card and the customer presenting it through a combination of cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and the entry of a PIN. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a protocol flaw which allows criminals to use a genuine card to make a payment without knowing the card's PIN, and to remain undetected even when the merchant has an online connection to the banking network. The fraudster performs a man-in-the-middle attack to trick the terminal into believing the PIN verified correctly, while telling the issuing bank that no PIN was entered at all. The paper considers how the flaws arose, why they remained unknown despite EMV's wide deployment for the best part of a decade, and how they might be fixed. Because we have found and validated a practical attack against the core functionality of EMV, we conclude that the protocol is broken. This failure is significant in the field of protocol design, and also has important public policy implications, in light of growing reports of fraud on stolen EMV cards. Frequently, banks deny such fraud victims a refund, asserting that a card cannot be used without the correct PIN, and concluding that the customer must be grossly negligent or lying. Our attack can explain a number of these cases, and exposes the need for further research to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical security of bank payment systems. Smart cards have gradually replaced magnetic strip cards for point-of-sale and ATM transactions in many countries. The leading system, EMV (named after Europay, MasterCard, and Visa), has been deployed throughout most of Europe, and is currently being rolled out in Canada. As of early 2008, there were over 730 million EMV compliant smart cards in circulation worldwide. In EMV, customers authorize a credit or debit card transaction by inserting their card and entering a PIN into a point-of-sale terminal; the PIN is typically verified by the smart card chip, which is in turn authenticated to the terminal by a digital certificate. The transaction details are also authenticated by a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC), using a symmetric key shared between the payment card and the bank that issued the card to the customer (the issuer). EMV was heavily promoted under the "Chip and PIN" brand during its national rollout in the UK. The technology was advertised as a solution to increasing card fraud: a chip to prevent card counterfeiting, and a PIN to prevent abuse of stolen cards. Since its introduction in the UK the fraud landscape has changed significantly: lost and stolen card fraud is down, and counterfeit card fraud experienced a two year lull. But no type of fraud has been eliminated, and the overall fraud levels have actually risen (see Figure 1). The likely explanation for this is that EMV has simply moved fraud, not eliminated it. One goal of EMV was to externalise the costs of dispute from the issuing bank, in that if a disputed transaction has been authorised by a manuscript signature, it would be charged to the merchant, while if it had been authorised by a PIN then it would be charged to the customer. The net effect is that the banking industry, which was responsible for the design of the system, carries less liability for the fraud. The industry describes this as a 'liability shift'. In the past few years, the UK media have reported numerous cases where cardholders' complaints have been rejected by their bank and by government-approved mediators such as the Financial Ombudsman Service, using stock excuses such as 'Your card was CHIP read and a PIN was used so you must have been negligent.' Interestingly, an increasing number of complaints from believable witnesses indicate that their EMV cards were fraudulently used shortly after being stolen, despite there having been no possibility that the thief could have learned the PIN. In this paper, we describe a potential explanation. We have demonstrated how criminals can use stolen "Chip and PIN" (EMV) smart cards without knowing the PIN. Since "verified by PIN" -- the essence of the system -- does not work, we declare the Chip and PIN system to be broken. Speaker: Steven J.

But while Dodd-Frank aims to reduce investors' reliance on ratings, it does not prevent them from doing so. And for those who do, Dodd-Frank says courts can hold a credit agency financially liable if it committed fraud or acted recklessly in preparing a rating. In other words, when credit agencies act irresponsibly, they can no longer rely on First Amendment protection against suits brought by investors.

This presumption effectively allowed plaintiffs to bring securities suits as class actions.

In its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, KVH reported a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting arising from a fraudulent scheme by the most senior member of its accounting staff at its Danish subsidiary to misappropriate assets from KVH over a period of at least three years. The scheme included fraudulent wire transfers to a personal bank account, fraudulent documentation, forged signatures and use of a corporate credit card for personal expenses. For the three years ended December 31, 2013, the aggregate amount of misappropriated funds in any year ranged from approximately $118,000 to $250,000. KVH recovered these losses in 2013 through its insurance policies. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of KVH's internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2012 identified the following control deficiencies at its Danish subsidiary as a material weakness: (i) override of access controls over banking security devices and personal identification numbers enabling the unauthorized execution of wire transfers, (ii) ineffective review controls over the supporting documentation by the subsidiary country general manager over expenditures and expenses, and (iii) override of review controls designed to address the accuracy and approval of manual journal entries at the Danish subsidiary. As a result of this material weakness, KPMG's report on KVH's internal control over financial reporting concluded that KVH did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.

Ashwani Gujral: I do not think liquidity is going to turn overnight and the market is giving you a fresh breakout and chances are we should see next levels of 8200. Basically it is blue sky territory. What is good is that a lot of infrastructure and PSU stocks have started to move. So maybe this rally will allow them to move higher because these market leading groups, the policy sensitivities must perform, otherwise there is only a limited amount that the defensives can take the market higher by, because the room on the upside is there only in PSUs and infrastructure. So that being said, a lot of bad news is getting absorbed. PSU banks are absorbing a lot of bad news regarding frauds, etc. So the view should be long. Autos and pharma remain sort of evergreen type of sectors but there is good market rotation and it will be difficult for market to correct substantially given that so many sectors are participating.

In January 2010, for example, Edelman exposed Blucora's role in a complex ad fraud scheme (which incidentally involved AdOn Network, a Blinkx subsidiary). At the time, Professor Edelman stated 4 : "Google doesn't need InfoSpace, and there's zero reason for this relationship to continue in light of InfoSpace's repeated failings." Blucora seemed to show some remorse, as it "discontinued the syndication of our search results to certain distribution partners who we deemed to be delivering low quality clicks." 5 BCOR took a hit to revenue, and its share price suffered as well.

Like many financial institutions, organizations should adopt the same best practices to encrypt and send encrypted passwords and sensitive data over a communication channel in addition to the SSL protection. This can be done by using an encryption library and key data for data encryption at the point of entry (user desktop/smartphone) before submission to the server side. This data remains encrypted all the way to the web server and even the application server. The data may be decrypted at the application server, however in the case of passwords, they remain encrypted and are verified inside a Hardware Security Module (HSM). HSMs are cryptographic devices using tamper resistant hardware built to meet the FIPS standards. Thus, the passwords are encrypted from the point of entry to the point of comparison. Apart from mitigating against Heartbleed type of vulnerabilities, this ensures that nobody in the intranet has access to the password in clear during transit and storage, as well as protecting against internal fraud.

The reason, of course, is weev, known to the court as Andrew Auernheimer. We're here for his appeal trial, a reexamination of the ruling that sent the troll-slash-security-researcher to prison last year. He was convicted of computer fraud for accessing and publishing the emails of 114,000 iPad users, held on an AT&T server. The final sentence was for 41 months in prison and $73,000 in restitution payments, but it was overshadowed by the trial itself. Supporters had smuggled in phones to surreptitiously live-tweet the proceedings, and the trial kept grinding to a halt so the bailiff could eject them. As a result, nine months later, we're walking through a metal detector in full view of an explosives-sniffing dog.
The spokesperson also said in the statement it would be “unfair” to identify a single source of a compromise before a criminal and forensic investigations are complete. “Similarly, disclosing the name of the compromised entity would become a powerful disincentive for the compromised entity to share time-sensitive information with Visa and law enforcement. It’s also important to recognize that law enforcement may request that the name of the compromised entity not be disclosed before the investigation is complete, as it has the potential to tip off the fraudsters and interfere with the criminal investigation,” the statement said.

Otherwise, the spouse could be accused of “fraudulent transfer.” That’s what the law calls it when a person deliberately tries to reduce assets by giving them away, changing the title of property, etc..., so that there is less for creditors to confiscate. As a result, Morrow cautions those that live in a state such as California or Maine, “even a rollover IRA could be subject to creditors in bankruptcy.”

If the ID still reflects the service member's SSN, at that point their identity is compromised and new account fraud typically follows.

It's laudable that Johnson wants to make it easier for Michiganders to vote, and that she is concerned about voter fraud, a serious matter. But let's be clear — there's no evidence of widespread voter fraud in Michigan, and there are no reports that voter fraud, or allegations of voter fraud, have increased in states with no-reason absentee voting. Focusing on this nonexistent threat at the expense of access to the franchise is the wrong decision.

Many of these NFL tickets may be purchased with an instant E-Ticket option, meaning a paper ticket for the football game may be printed right from the computer of the purchaser immediately after the easy online sales transaction. The printed tickets and computer systems at the stadiums, like Mile High Stadium or Bank Of America Stadium, make using the tickets printed at home as easy as standard tickets from the box office. With the 125% ticket guarantee of authenticity and guaranteed admission to the game fans need not be concerned with nervousness about an E-ticket if they may never have used one.

SMS toll fraud, SMS phishing and malware trojans are just a few examples of how inventive miscreants are subverting smartphones, tablets, dongle-enabled laptops and mobile apps by inserting malicious code into legitimate apps to lure victims to bogus websites and services where they can then be exploited for financial gain. Along with the growth of app stores (especially for Android-based devices) - many of which have no security oversight or 'curated' control - comes increased risk of compromised devices and unwitting users participating in botnets and launching DDoS attacks from the wireless side of the mobile network. This type of threat has the added potential to exhaust precious resources in the highest cost-per-bit part of the network: the radio access network (RAN).

Rengan Rajaratnam, the younger brother of imprisoned hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam, on Friday lost a bid to dismiss some of the insider trading charges he is facing. United States District Court Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan ruled that the indictment adequately claimed the essential elements of the crimes charged. Judge Buchwald agreed that four securities fraud counts were “internally inconsistent” with a conspiracy charge contained in the indictment. But she withheld ruling on whether to dismiss them to allow the government to decide whether to proceed on those charges. A lawyer for Mr. Rajaratnam did not respond to a request for comment. Raj Rajaratnam, founder of the hedge fund Galleon Group, received an 11-year prison sentence in October 2011 after a jury convicted him on charges related to insider trading. A grand jury indicted Rengan Rajaratnam, a former portfolio manager at Galleon, in March 2013 on one conspiracy count and six counts of securities fraud.

Most traditional credit cards in the United States today use a magnetic strip and a customer signature to seal a deal.

The possibility that the funds we negotiated so hard for in Brussels may be plundered is one of the biggest threats today. As we fought the downturn and worked to save our country from bankruptcy, we saw very clearly that the shortage of funds is not Lithuania’s biggest problem.

Lithuania can become a country of possibilities for honest people, if we do not allow cheats and fraudsters to usurp it.

MEXICAN INVESTIGATION Mexico's banking regulator said on Monday it is also investigating whether Banamex committed crimes or flouted regulations.

Gonzalez said he hoped to have conclusions from the investigation in two to three weeks.

The judiciary must always be mindful that it serves a public function and ultimately exists to serve the citizenry — not just the parties who appear before it. While I concede that the purpose of a settlement isn’t to establish the truth of every matter in dispute, at least some facts may go a long way toward dispelling public suspicion that another Wall Street bank is getting off easy. Or that the government is shaking down banks that can’t sustain the damage to their reputations of being accused of fraud, even if they are innocent.

The oil and gas industry has been the worst hit by this trend of indiscriminate probes by the National Assembly. It all started with the subsidy probe upon allegations that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had paid itself huge sums of money beyond what was appropriated for fuel subsidy in 2011. The House of Representatives promptly set up an ad hoc committee chaired by Hon. Farouk Lawan to look into the allegations. Though the report of the committee was mired in allegations of bribery against the lawmaker who was seen in a video negotiating bribe with businessman and oil mogul, Mr. Femi Otedola, one salient finding of the committee was that neither the NNPC nor the Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke, was involved in any fraudulent act in the whole subsidy scam. Those indicted are already being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Yet many Nigerians, especially media practitioners and public affairs analysts, based on the way the National Assembly handled the probe, still believe that NNPC and the Minister of Petroleum Resources were indicted.

Five Former Employees of Bernie Madoff Found Guilty Of Fraud
Pakistan protesters clash with Islamabad police Pakistan police have fired tear gas at anti-government protesters marching on the official Islamabad residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. At least 16 people, including two policemen, were injured in the clashes. Demonstrators loyal to opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahrul Qadri have been taking part in a sit-in for two weeks. They want the current government to resign, alleging corruption and electoral fraud. On Friday Pakistan's powerful army chief, Gen Raheel Sharif, stepped in to mediate amid an ongoing deadlock. Imran Khan ended talks with the government last week. A government minister said that repeated attempts to resolve the two-week long standoff with protesters had failed. Military helicopters were despatched to survey the scene on the Constitution Avenue, one of the most secure zones in the city, housing a number of government buildings and residences. The violence was sparked when the two opposition leaders ordered their supporters, many whom were wielding batons, to move closer to the PM's house. The protesters began their sit-in after a huge march from Lahore to Islamabad two weeks ago, vowing to camp out in the capital until the government stood down. Last year's elections marked Pakistan's first civilian transfer of power.

Since then, Mr Browder says in his submission to the court, he has been fighting to hold his killers responsible.
